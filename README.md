Key Features and ExplanationsGoogle OAuth2 Login:Uses google-auth-oauthlib to handle Google authentication.Tokens are encrypted with AES-256 and stored securely in files named token_<email>.json.Login status is tracked in an SQLite database (grass_accounts.db).AES-256 Encryption:Implements AES-256-GCM mode for encrypting sensitive data (tokens, credentials).A 32-byte encryption key is generated and stored in encryption_key.bin.Helper functions encrypt_data and decrypt_data handle encryption/decryption.Database Management:SQLite database stores email, encrypted token, login status, last points, and last check time.The update_account_status function ensures login status and points are updated.Farming Automation:API-based: Assumes a WebSocket connection to the Grass API (placeholder wss://api.getgrass.io/websocket). You’ll need to replace this with the actual endpoint and payload structure based on Grass’s documentation or reverse-engineered API.Browser-based: Uses Selenium to simulate browser actions (placeholder selectors). Customize with actual Grass login and reward-claiming elements.Claims rewards hourly (adjustable via time.sleep or schedule).Balance Retrieval:The get_grass_balance function retrieves the $GRASS balance via a placeholder API endpoint.Updates the database with the latest balance and logs the result.Monitoring and Auto-Restart:The monitor_accounts function checks every 60 minutes if points are still being earned.If no points are accumulated (balance unchanged), it restarts the farming session.Backups:Hourly backups of the log file (grass_bot.log) and database (grass_accounts.db) are saved to grass_backups/backup_<timestamp>.Cloud backup (e.g., Google Drive) is mentioned but requires additional setup (e.g., google-auth-httplib2 for Drive API).Error Handling and Logging:Comprehensive logging to grass_bot.log for debugging and tracking.Errors during login, farming, or balance retrieval are logged, and accounts are marked as "FAILED" in the database.Customization NotesGrass API/WebSocket: The code uses placeholder URLs and payloads (wss://api.getgrass.io/websocket, claim_rewards). Replace these with actual Grass API endpoints or WebSocket commands based on documentation or reverse-engineering (e.g., from GitHub sources like,,).Browser Automation: The Selenium-based start_browser_farming function uses placeholder selectors (google_login_button, claim_rewards). Inspect the Grass website (app.getgrass.io) to find actual element IDs or classes.Google OAuth2 Setup: Create a Google Cloud project, enable the People API, and download client_secrets.json. Set the redirect URI to http://localhost:port (e.g., http://localhost:8080).Proxy Support: If Grass detects and bans proxies (as noted in), integrate a proxy manager (e.g., SOCKS5 proxies) as shown in GitHub examples (,,).Cloud Backup: For cloud storage, implement Google Drive API or another service using libraries like google-auth-httplib2.Security ConsiderationsEncryption Key: Store encryption_key.bin securely (e.g., restrict file permissions). If lost, encrypted tokens cannot be recovered.Token Storage: Tokens are encrypted, but ensure token_<email>.json files are not exposed.Rate Limits: Grass may impose rate limits or proxy detection (). Use high-quality proxies and respect API limits to avoid bans.Database Security: If using a remote database, secure it with proper access controls.UsageInstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.Set up Google OAuth2 credentials and save client_secrets.json in the script directory.Update emails list with Google account emails.Replace placeholder Grass API endpoints or browser selectors with actual values.Run the script: python grass_bot.py.Monitor grass_bot.log for activity and errors.Check grass_backups for hourly backups.Limitations and Next StepsAPI Details: Without official Grass API documentation, you’ll need to reverse-engineer endpoints or use browser automation. GitHub repositories (,,,) suggest WebSocket connections with SOCKS5 proxies are common.Browser Automation: Selenium requires ChromeDriver and may need headless mode for VPS deployment.Scalability: For many accounts, consider threading or asyncio to run sessions concurrently.Proxy Management: Integrate a proxy rotator to avoid detection (as suggested in).
